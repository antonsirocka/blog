I'm a cloud engineer with background in .net development who found passion in cloud infrastructure solutions. 

This blog is a collection of my tips and insights gathered over time that may prove useful to other devs tackling similar issues in their day to day jobs.

The content is mostly, but not exclusively, focused on Azure platform and related technologies.
