There are many reasons why a full cluster migration may be required. For example moving to a new hosting platform, implementing zone-redundancy for worker nodes, changing cluster configuration to use managed identity (as opposed to managing the service principal yourself) or simply performing a risky cluster upgrade (AKS 1.17 -> 1.18 changes Ubuntu OS version, 1.18 -> 1.19 changes default container runtime interface). Doing a zero-downtime migration is definitely possible, but requires careful planning.","socialImage":"../../media/kubernetes-migration.jpg"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/automate-lets-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-deployment-to-an-azure-vm","categorySlug":"/category/security/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Automate Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate deployment to an Azure VM","date":"2021-02-21T14:48:32.169Z","category":"Security","description":"Automating TLS certificate issuing via Let's Encrypt is very straight-forward in new emerging orchestrators like Kubernetes.
