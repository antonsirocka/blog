There are many reasons why a full cluster migration may be required. For example moving to a new hosting platform, implementing zone-redundancy for worker nodes, changing cluster configuration to use managed identity (as opposed to managing the service principal yourself) or simply performing a risky cluster upgrade (AKS 1.17 -> 1.18 changes Ubuntu OS version, 1.18 -> 1.19 changes default container runtime interface). Doing a zero-downtime migration is definitely possible, but requires careful planning.","socialImage":"../../media/kubernetes-migration.jpg"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"AKS","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/aks","nextPagePath":"/tag/aks/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
